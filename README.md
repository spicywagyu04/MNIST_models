# MNIST_models
This repo contains my fun experimentations with neural networks on classifying handwritten digits in MNIST dataset. It started with the motivation to test the capability of neural networks with purely linear layers in classifying handwritten digits. 

So no fancy convolutions ;D

## Models
__MNIST_Model_v1:__ a very basic neural net with a single hidden linear layer

__MNIST_Model_v2:__ model is same as __MNIST_Model_v1__, but with mixup
